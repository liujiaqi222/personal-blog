First, let's address your premises:

"Vue.js being more performant": This isn't universally true, although Vue often has a reputation for excellent performance, particularly regarding its virtual DOM implementation and optimizations.

Reality: Both React and Vue are extremely performant JavaScript frameworks. Performance differences in real-world applications are often negligible and depend far more on how the application is built (code splitting, component optimization, state management strategies, etc.) than on the core framework itself. Benchmarks might show slight advantages for one over the other in specific micro-tasks, but these rarely translate into significant user-perceived differences in well-architected apps. Both have undergone significant performance improvements over the years.
Correction: It's more accurate to say both are highly performant, and choosing one solely based on minor benchmark differences is usually not practical.
 "Vue.js being simpler": Vue is often perceived as having a gentler learning curve, especially for developers familiar with traditional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.   

Reality: Vue's template syntax feels very familiar to HTML, and its core concepts (like directives v-if, v-for) can be intuitive. Its official documentation is widely praised for clarity. React's use of JSX (embedding HTML-like syntax in JavaScript) and concepts like hooks can initially seem less straightforward to some, especially beginners.
Nuance: "Simplicity" is subjective. Some developers find React's approach of "just JavaScript" (once JSX is understood) and its functional programming paradigms cleaner in the long run, especially for complex state logic. Vue's "magic" (like reactive directives) can sometimes make debugging complex interactions harder for those accustomed to explicit JavaScript. Vue's Options API is often seen as simpler initially, while its Composition API (introduced later) is more comparable to React Hooks in complexity and power.   
Correction: While Vue often has a reputation for an easier initial learning curve, especially with its Options API and template syntax, the long-term simplicity depends on developer background and project complexity. React's explicitness can be seen as simpler by others once its core concepts are grasped.
Why People Choose React Despite Vue's Strengths:

Even considering Vue's perceived easier learning curve and excellent performance, there are compelling reasons why many developers and companies choose React:

 Massive Ecosystem and Community: React has been around slightly longer in widespread use and benefits from a significantly larger community. This translates to:   

More third-party libraries, tools, and components.
More tutorials, articles, courses, and Stack Overflow answers.
A larger pool of developers available for hire.
Job Market: Due to its widespread adoption, particularly in larger companies and startups (especially in the US), there are generally more job openings requesting React skills compared to Vue. This is a major driver for developers learning React.

 Corporate Backing and Stability: React is developed and maintained by Meta (Facebook). This strong corporate backing gives companies confidence in the framework's longevity, resources, and continued development. (Vue also has strong community backing and corporate usage, but Meta's influence is undeniable).   

Flexibility and Unopinionated Nature: React primarily focuses on the UI layer ("the V in MVC"). It doesn't dictate choices for routing, state management, or build tooling. While this means more decisions need to be made upfront (e.g., choosing between Redux, Zustand, Jotai, MobX for state management), many developers prefer this flexibility to tailor the stack precisely to their needs. Vue, while also flexible, offers more official, integrated solutions (like Vue Router, Pinia/Vuex) which can feel more "batteries-included" but potentially less flexible for those wanting different approaches.   

React Native: For teams needing to develop native mobile applications alongside web applications, React Native offers a way to leverage existing React knowledge and potentially share some code (logic, not components directly). This is a significant advantage for cross-platform development strategies. Vue has native solutions like NativeScript-Vue or Weex, but React Native has broader adoption and a larger ecosystem.

Developer Preference and Team Experience: Many developers learned React first and are simply more comfortable and productive with its patterns (JSX, hooks, component structure). Teams often choose technologies their members already know well.

In Summary:

The choice between React and Vue isn't usually about one being definitively "better," "faster," or "simpler" across the board.

Vue's Strengths often cited: Gentle initial learning curve (especially Options API), excellent documentation, great performance, well-integrated official companion libraries (Router, Pinia), clean Single File Components (.vue).
React's Strengths often cited: Huge ecosystem, massive community support, vast job market, strong corporate backing, flexibility in choosing architectural components, powerful ecosystem for mobile development (React Native).   
People often choose React because of its larger ecosystem, job market dominance, the flexibility it offers, and the seamless path to mobile development via React Native, even if Vue might seem slightly easier to pick up initially for some. The decision often depends on project requirements, team expertise, long-term goals, and familiarity.
