Next.js uses **file-system based routing**, meaning you can use folders and files to define routes. This page will guide you through how to create layouts and pages, and link between them.

  ## Creating a page

  A **page** is UI that is rendered on a specific route. To create a page, add a [`page` file](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page) inside the `app` directory and default export a React component. For example, to create an index page (`/`):

  ![page.js special file](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fpage-special-file.png&w=3840&q=75)

  

  

  

  ```ts
  export default function Page() {
    return <h1>Hello Next.js!</h1>
  }
  ```

  ## Creating a layout

  A layout is UI that is **shared** between multiple pages. On navigation, layouts preserve state, remain interactive, and do not rerender.

  You can define a layout by default exporting a React component from a [`layout` file](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout). The component should accept a `children` prop which can be a page or another [layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/layouts-and-pages#nesting-layouts).

  For example, to create a layout that accepts your index page as child, add a `layout` file inside the `app` directory:

  ![layout.js special file](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Flayout-special-file.png&w=3840&q=75)

  

  app/layout.tsx

  

  



  The layout above is called a [root layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout#root-layouts) because it's defined at the root of the `app` directory. The root layout is **required** and must contain `html` and `body` tags.

  ## Creating a nested route

  A nested route is a route composed of multiple URL segments. For example, the `/blog/[slug]` route is composed of three segments:

  - `/` (Root Segment)
  - `blog` (Segment)
  - `[slug]` (Leaf Segment)

  In Next.js:

  - **Folders** are used to define the route segments that map to URL segments.
  - **Files** (like `page` and `layout`) are used to create UI that is shown for a segment.

  To create nested routes, you can nest folders inside each other. For example, to add a route for `/blog`, create a folder called `blog` in the `app` directory. Then, to make `/blog` publicly accessible, add a `page` file:

  ![File hierarchy showing blog folder and a page.js file](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fblog-nested-route.png&w=3840&q=75)



  app/blog/page.tsx

  ```ts
  import { getPosts } from '@/lib/posts'
  import { Post } from '@/ui/post'
   
  export default async function Page() {
    const posts = await getPosts()
   
    return (
      <ul>
        {posts.map((post) => (
          <Post key={post.id} post={post} />
        ))}
      </ul>
    )
  }
  ```

  You can continue nesting folders to create nested routes. For example, to create a route for a specific blog post, create a new `[slug]` folder inside `blog` and add a `page` file:

  ![File hierarchy showing blog folder with a nested slug folder and a page.js file](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fblog-post-nested-route.png&w=3840&q=75)

  

  app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx

  TypeScript

  


  > **Good to know**: Wrapping a folder name in square brackets (e.g. `[slug]`) creates a special [dynamic route segment](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) used to generate multiple pages from data. This is useful for blog posts, product pages, etc.

  ## Nesting layouts

  By default, layouts in the folder hierarchy are also nested, which means they wrap child layouts via their `children` prop. You can nest layouts by adding `layout` inside specific route segments (folders).

  For example, to create a layout for the `/blog` route, add a new `layout` file inside the `blog` folder.

  ![File hierarchy showing root layout wrapping the blog layout](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fnested-layouts.png&w=3840&q=75)

  

  app/blog/layout.tsx

  

  


  If you were to combine the two layouts above, the root layout (`app/layout.js`) would wrap the blog layout (`app/blog/layout.js`), which would wrap the blog (`app/blog/page.js`) and blog post page (`app/blog/[slug]/page.js`).

  ## Linking between pages
  You can use the [component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) to navigate between routes. `<Link>` is a built-in Next.js component that extends the HTML `<a>` tag to provide prefetching and client-side navigation.

  For example, to generate a list of blog posts, import `<Link>` from `next/link` and pass a `href` prop to the component:

  

  app/ui/post.tsx

  

  



  `<Link>` is the primary and recommended way to navigate between routes in your Next.js application. However, you can also use the [`useRouter` hook](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router) for more advanced navigation.
